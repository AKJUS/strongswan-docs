= Programming Style

* Use tabs for indentation, tab width is 4

* Do not exceed a line width of 80 characters

* Statements that span multiple lines are usually indented to the opening bracket
  (using tabs, then spaces)

* Curly brackets follow on a new line (Allman style), except for structs and enums

* Always explicitly define a block after if/else with curly brackets

* Empty lines should not contain any whitespace

* Add a space between variables and operators

* Add a space between if/while and opening bracket

* No space between function name and opening bracket

* Add a space after a comma, as in natural (English) language

* structs/enums are typedef'd with the same name

* Defined types have a `*_t*` suffix

* No C++ style comments //

* Add the comment on a separate line, above the statement you are commenting

* Declare variables at the beginning of the block

* Function/member declarations use a Doxygen /** comment */

* Use `*@*` as the Doxygen escape character (not `*\*`)
