Since its beginning the strongSwan project has been using a virtualized integration
and regression testing environment to ensure the quality of each release. The
{TESTS}[test results] of the latest release are always published online.

The test environment is based on {KVM}[KVM] and reproducible guest images based
on Debian. In earlier releases it was based on User-Mode-Linux (UML) and a Gentoo
base image.

NOTE: Hardware virtualization support is required (Intel VT/AMD-V). This means
      that running the testing environment in a VM itself generally doesn't work.
      It might with newer VMware products, though.

== Building the Testing Environment

=== Supported Architectures

The host system currently has to run the same architecture as the guests, whose
architecture can be changed via `*BASEIMGARCH*` in
{GITHUB}/testing/testing.conf[`*testing/testing.conf*`] or in
`*testing/testing.conf.local*` that is not managed by Git. The only fully supported
architecture currently is `*amd64*`.

=== Required Packages

On Debian/Ubuntu (must be recent, Debian 6.0 `*squeeze*` won't work), the following
packages are required to build the testing environment:
----
* debootstrap
* e2fsprogs
* kvm
* libvirt-bin
* parted
* qemu
* wget
* gcc
* make
----

=== Configuration and Build

All the required scripts, config files and test suites are located in the
{GITHUB}/testing[`testing`] directory of the Git repository or a release tarball.

Before starting the build you may want to modify some of the variables in the
`*testing.conf*` file or `*testing.conf.local*` that is not managed by Git.
For instance, the `*TESTDIR*` variable defines the root directory in which the
whole testing environment will be built and by setting any of the `*ENABLE_BUILD_**`
variables to `*no*` you can avoid re-building parts of the environment that have
already been built earlier.

Building is started by executing the `*make-testing*` script:

 ./make-testing

Several applications are built from sources
({GITHUB}/testing/scripts/recipes[`testing/scripts/recipes`]) in the root image.

To rebuild and install strongSwan from the current or an arbitrary source tree
within the root image the
{GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-strongswan[`*testing/scripts/build-strongswan*`]
script is provided since version 5.2.1.

Since version 5.8.0, the
{GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-certs[`*testing/scripts/build-certs*`] script
creates the keys and certificates used in the test scenarios dynamically. The
scripts has to be run once after the root image has been created (the guest images
are [re-]built automatically).

=== Platform-Specific Notes

On systems with *AppArmor* installed, `*libvirt*` uses the latter to secure
virtual machines. When creating a guest, `*libvirt*` automatically creates
AppArmor profiles. The problem is that **older versions** (< 7.1.0) didn't create
profiles that reflect the multi-layered disk images we use (each guest's image
is linked to a common root image which in turn is linked to a common base image).
One option to fix this is for affected versions of `*libvirt*` is to set
`*security_driver = "none"*` in `*/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf*` and execute

 sudo service libvirt-bin restart

== Using the Testing Environment

=== Starting the Environment

When the strongSwan testing environment has been put into place by running the
`*make-testing*` script, you are ready to start up the KVM instances by calling

 ./start-testing

The virtual topology looks like this:

image::topology.png[topology]

=== Running the Automated Tests

The script

 ./do-tests <testnames>

runs the automated tests. If the `<testnames>` argument is omitted all tests are
executed. Otherwise only the tests listed will be run as shown in the following
example:

 ./do-tests ikev2/net2net-psk ikev2/net2net-cert

Each test is divided into the following phases:

* Load the test-specific guest configuration if any is provided.

* Next the `*pretest.dat*` script found in each test directory is executed. Among
  other commands, strongSwan is started on the IPsec hosts.

* The `*evaltest.dat*` script evaluates if the test has been successful.

* The `*posttest.dat*` script terminates the test e.g. by stopping strongSwan on
  the IPsec hosts. It is also responsible to clean things up (e.g. firewall rules)
  that were set up in `*pretest.dat*`.

* Restore the default configuration on every host (new files have to be deleted
  manually in `*posttest.dat*`).

The test results and configuration files for all tests are stored in a folder
labeled with the current date and time in directory specified by the
`*TESTRESULTSDIR*` variable in `*testing.conf*`.

The same results are also automatically transferred to the Apache server running
on guest winnetou and can be accessed via the URL

 http://192.168.0.150/testresults/

=== Manual Testing

Instead of running tests automatically with `*do-tests*` it is possible to preload
a test scenario with the script:

 scripts/load-testconfig <testname>

Individual configuration files can be changed and any command can be executed by
logging on to a guest host directly (via SSH or a console window). No password is
required to login as root.

Also, the sources for every software built during `*make-testing*` are mounted at
`*/root/shared*` which allows to change and recompile these components. Please
note that before being able to successfully compile one of the components inside
a guest you first have to execute `*make clean*` in the component's source
directory (the same applies if you later want to rebuild the images with
`*make-testing*`).

After you finished testing, the default configuration can be restored with the
following command (newly created files have to be deleted manually):

 scripts/restore-defaults
