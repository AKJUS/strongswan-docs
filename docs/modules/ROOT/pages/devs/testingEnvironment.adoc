Since its beginning, the strongSwan project has been using a virtualized
integration and regression testing environment to ensure the quality of each
release. The {TESTS}[test results] of the latest release are always published
online.

The test environment is based on {KVM}[KVM] and reproducible guest images based
on Debian. In earlier releases it was based on User-Mode-Linux (UML) and a Gentoo
base image.

NOTE: Hardware virtualization support is required (Intel VT/AMD-V). So running
      the testing environment in a VM itself generally doesn't work. However,
      it might with newer hypervisors that support nested virtualization.

== Building the Testing Environment

=== Supported Architectures

The host system currently has to run the same architecture as the guests, whose
architecture can be changed via `*BASEIMGARCH*` in
{GITHUB}/testing/testing.conf[`*testing/testing.conf*`] or in
`*testing/testing.conf.local*` that is not managed by Git. The only fully supported
architecture currently is `*amd64*`.

=== Required Packages

On Debian/Ubuntu, the following packages are required to build the testing
environment:
----
* debootstrap
* e2fsprogs
* kvm
* libvirt-bin
* parted
* qemu
* wget
* gcc
* make
----

=== Configuration and Build

All the required scripts, config files and test suites are located in the
{GITHUB}/testing[`*testing*`] directory of the Git repository or a release tarball.

Before starting the build, you may want to modify some of the variables in the
`*testing.conf*` file, or in `*testing.conf.local*`, which is not managed by Git.
For instance, the `*TESTDIR*` variable defines the root directory in which the
whole testing environment will be built. And by setting any of the `*ENABLE_BUILD_**`
variables to `*no*`, you can avoid rebuilding parts of the environment that have
already been built earlier. Although, the latter can also be achieved by manually
running the respective build scripts (see below).

Building is started by executing the `*make-testing*` script:

 testing/make-testing

By default, this calls the following scripts:

 * {GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-guestkernel[`*testing/scripts/build-guestkernel*`]:
   Builds a Linux kernel for use by the KVM guest hosts. The version etc. can be
   changed in the config file.
   It's also possible to use an already built kernel from an arbitrary source
   tree by creating `*$BUILDDIR/linux-<name>*` as a symlink and
   configuring `*KERNELVERSION=<name>*` (compatible kernel configs can be found
   in {GITHUB}/testing/config/kernel[`testing/config/kernel`]).

 * {GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-baseimage[`*testing/scripts/build-baseimage*`]:
   Creates a Debian-based "base" image on which all other images are based. This
   changes quite rarely.

 * {GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-rootimage[`*testing/scripts/build-rootimage*`]:
   Creates a "root" image on top of the base image, in which several
   applications/libraries are built and installed from sources
   ({GITHUB}/testing/scripts/recipes[`testing/scripts/recipes`]).
   This includes strongSwan, which is why the script nowadays simply calls the
   `*build-strongswan*` script with specific arguments (see below).

 * {GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-certs[`*testing/scripts/build-certs*`]:
   Generates certificates and keys for the test scenarios. This uses the tools
   installed in the root image in a chroot. It automatically calls the next
   script to [re]build the guest images.

 * {GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-guestimages[`*testing/scripts/build-guestimages*`]:
   Creates guest images for the KVM hosts based on the root image and the
   generated credentials.

As mentioned, for more control, these scripts can all be called manually to
[re]build specific parts of the testing environment.

*To rebuild and install strongSwan* from the current or an arbitrary source tree
within the root image, the
{GITHUB}/testing/scripts/build-strongswan[`*testing/scripts/build-strongswan*`]
script may be used. It automatically calls the `*build-certs*` and
`*build-guestimages*` scripts if necessary. Various optional arguments control
what's actually built (it's e.g. possible to completely rebuild the root image,
or only install strongSwan in the guest image of a particular guest, see
`*--help*` for details).

The
{GITHUB}/testing/scripts/chroot[`*testing/scripts/chroot* base|root|<guest>`]
command allows to modify a particular image in a chroot environment. Images
depending on a modified image have to be rebuilt afterwards. For the
root and guest images, the sources of the installed software are mounted
at `*/root/shared*` (that's also the case when the hosts are running).

=== Platform-Specific Notes

On systems with *AppArmor* installed, `*libvirt*` uses the latter to secure
virtual machines. When creating a guest, `*libvirt*` automatically creates
AppArmor profiles. The problem is that **older versions** (< 7.1.0) didn't create
profiles that reflect the multi-layered disk images we use (each guest's image
is linked to the common root image which in turn is linked to the common base image).
One option to fix this is for affected versions of `*libvirt*` is to set
`*security_driver = "none"*` in `*/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf*` and execute

 sudo service libvirt-bin restart

== Using the Testing Environment

=== Starting the Environment

When the strongSwan testing environment has been put into place by running the
build scripts, you are ready to start up the KVM instances by calling

 testing/start-testing

The virtual topology looks like this:

image::topology.png[topology]

=== Running the Automated Tests

The script

 testing/do-tests <testnames>

runs the automated tests. If the `<testnames>` argument is omitted, all tests are
executed. Otherwise, only the tests listed will be run as shown in the following
example:

 ./do-tests ikev2/net2net-psk ikev2/net2net-cert

Wildcards are also supported:

 testing/do-tests ikev2/net2net-*

See `*--help*` for some advanced options.

Each test scenario is divided into the following phases:

* Load the test-specific guest configuration if any is provided.

* The `*pretest.dat*` script found in each test directory is executed. Among
  other commands, strongSwan is started on the IPsec hosts.

* The `*evaltest.dat*` script evaluates if the test has been successful.

* The `*posttest.dat*` script terminates the test e.g. by stopping strongSwan on
  the IPsec hosts. It is also responsible to clean things up (e.g. firewall rules)
  that were set up in `*pretest.dat*`.

* Restore the default configuration on every host (new files have to be deleted
  manually in `*posttest.dat*`).

The test results and configuration files for all tests are stored in a folder
labeled with the current date and time in the directory specified by the
`*TESTRESULTSDIR*` variable in `*testing.conf*`.

The same results are also automatically available via the Apache server running
on guest *winnetou* and can be accessed via the URL

 http://192.168.0.150/testresults/

=== Manual Testing

Instead of running tests automatically with `*do-tests*` it is possible to preload
a test scenario with the script:

 testing/scripts/load-testconfig <testname>

Individual configuration files can be changed and any command can be executed by
logging on to a guest host directly. Either via SSH using the `*testing/ssh*`
script, or via serial console using e.g. `*virsh console --devname console1*` or
the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM). No password is required to login as root.

After you finished testing, the default configuration can be restored with the
following command (newly created files have to be deleted manually):

 testing/scripts/restore-defaults
