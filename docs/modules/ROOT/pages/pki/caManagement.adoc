== gnoMint

image::gnoMint.png[gnoMint]

{GNOMINT}[gnoMint] allows any person to run a Certification Authority, creating
certificates for any purpose: e-mail signing and/or crypting; TLS authentication
through web, VPNs or other protocols; secured web-servers... Its development was
started due to the lack of a 'just-works' CA software: creating a CA from zero,
through open-source command-line utilities, was possible, but was unconfortable
to remember all the neccessary parameters. And you had to create a difficult
configuration file. So here is {GNOMINT}[gnoMint], and it will help all systems
and network administrators to deploy a Certification Authority very easily.

=== Features

* Creating all the infrastructure to keep and run a Certification Authority,
  saved in only one file.

* Create Certification Signing Requests, allowing to export them to PKCS#8 files,
  so they can be send to other CAs.

* Create X.509 certificates, with a usual set of subject-parameters.

* Export certificates and private keys to PEM files, so they can be used by external
  applications.

* For each CA, establish a set of policies for certificate generation.

* Import CSRs made by other applications.

* Export PKCS#12 structures, so the certificates can be imported easily by web
  and mail clients.

* Revoke certificates, and generate the corresponding CRLs.

* Allow the possibility of keeping the CA private key or other private keys in
  external files or devices (as USB drives).

* Allow the management of a whole hierarchy of CAs with their respectives
  certificates.

* Import pre-existing Certification Authorities with all their data.

* Allows an easy CA operation from command-line tools, for batch certificate
  creation, or integration with other utilities.

=== Drawbacks

* With the exception of the Root CA key where the RSA key size can be chosen,
  only 2048 bit RSA end entity or intermediate CA keys are available which
  doesn't allow for a 128 bit security strength.

* No support of ECDSA keys.

* No support of `*subjectAlternativeNames*` which doesn't allow to use Fully
  Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) for hosts or email addresses for users as IKEv2
  identities.

* The selection of the Country Name from a dropdown list is quite tiresome.

* No new releases since version 1.3.0 in 2016.

== TinyCA 2

image::tinyCa.png[tinyCA]

{TINYCA2}[TinyCA] is a simple graphical user interface written in Perl/Gtk to
manage a small Certification Authority. TinyCA works as a frontend for openssl.

=== Features

* Unlimited CAs possible.

* Support for creating and managing Intermediate CAs.

* Creation and Revocation of X.509 certificates.

* PKCS#10 Requests can be imported and signed.

* Certificates can be exported as: PEM, DER, TXT or PKCS#12.

* Certificates can have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), an IP
  address or an email address as a `*subjectAlternativeName*`.

* Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

* CRLs can be exported as: PEM, DER and TXT.

=== Drawbacks

* No support of ECDSA keys.

* No new releases since version 0.7.5 in 2006.

== Xca

image::xca.png[Xca]

{XCA}[Xca] is a  graphical user interface for  handling  X.509  certificates,
RSA or ECDSA keys, PKCS#10 requests and CRLs in software and on smartcards.

=== Features

* Start your own PKI and create all kinds of private keys, certificates, requests
  or CRLs.

* Import and export them in any format like PEM, DER, PKCS#7, PKCS#12.

* Use them for your IPsec, OpenVPN, TLS or any other certificate based setup.

* Manage your Smart-Cards via PKCS#11 interface.

* Export certificates and requests as OpenSSL config file.

* Create Subject- and/or Extension- templates to ease issuing similar certs.

* Convert existing certificates or requests to templates.

* Get the broad support of x509v3 extensions as flexible as OpenSSL but more
  user-friendly.

* Adapt the columns to have your important information at a glance.
