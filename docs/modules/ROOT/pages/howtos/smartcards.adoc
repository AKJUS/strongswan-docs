== Introduction

Smart cards are a mature technology that prevents your user credentials from getting
easily compromised by theft. With the
xref:plugins/pkcs11.adoc[`*pkcs11*`] plugin, strongSwan can use any PKCS#11 library
to access smart cards, e.g. the one provided by the {OPENSC}[OpenSC] project.

This tutorial gives information on how to use a smartcard reader, initialize cards
and configure strongSwan with smartcards.

== Compatible Hardware

You need a USB smart card reader and a blank smart card, or a USB token that combines
the two in a convenient form factor, preferably with support of 2048 bit RSA or
256 bit ECDSA keys.

=== Compatible Card Readers

Thanks to {OPENSC}[OpenSC], Linux supports most {CCID}[CCID] smart card readers,
often using the {PCSC}[PCSC-Lite] library. Most recent USB card readers are compatible.

== Preparation

=== Smart Card Reader

To install pcsc-tools with CCID support, under Debian based distributions use:

 sudo apt-get install pcsc-tools libccid

strongSwan supports the PKCS#11 standard, which specifies how to access cryptographic
information on devices. Thus, any shared object file that provides a PKCS#11
interface may be used. In this tutorial we use {OPENSC}[OpenSC].

To install OpenSC use:

 sudo apt-get install opensc

Do not install the OpenCT package, as it is incompatible with the `*pcsc-lite*`
package.

Check that the card reader is correctly recognized by OpenSC:
----
$ opensc-tool -l
Readers known about:
Nr.    Driver     Name
0      pcsc       OmniKey CardMan 3121 00 00
----

At position Nr. `*0*` a Omnikey CardMan 3121 reader has been recognized. Let's
insert a smart card in the reader.

NOTE: When buying a smart card you'll also receive a *transport key*. Make sure
      that the `*transport key*` proposed by OpenSC matches the one you got in
      the mail. The smart card will be *irretrievably* blocked by entering the
      wrong key three times.

Let's double check that the card is recognized by printing its ATR:
----
$ opensc-tool -r0 -a
3b:9f:95:81:31:fe:9f:00:65:46:53:05:30:06:71:df:00:00:00:81:61:10:c6
----
We can also check the name of the card with the `*-n*` option (we can omit the
`*-r0*` argument since we only have one reader connected)
----
$ opensc-tool -n
Using reader with a card: OmniKey CardMan 3121 00 00
entersafe
----
At this point we know both the card and reader are fully recognized and functional.
We can now proceed to erase the card (you will be asked for the transport key you
got in your mail).

=== Certification Authority

To set up your CA you may use OpenSSL or the strongSwan xref:pki/pki.adoc[`*pki*`]
tool. To simplify things you may also use a
xref:pki/caManagementGui.adoc[graphical user interface] to set up your CA. One
important thing to keep in mind is that you shouldn't create private keys with a
key length not supported by your smart card (check the specs to be sure). RSA keys
with a maximum length of 2048 bits are known to work.

Make a backup of your keys/certificates and store it in a safe place.

With most cards/tokens it is also possible to generate the private keys directly
on the device. This way you can ensure nobody can get their hands on the keys but
you also can't create a backup, so any information encrypted with the corresponding
public key will be inaccessible if the card is lost or stolen.

=== Configuring a Smart Card with pkcsc15-init

Credentials on smart cards are usually stored according to the PKCS#15 Cryptographic
Token Information Format Standard fully supported by OpenSC. The following command
erases the card and removes the existing PKCS#15 structure and all stored
cryptographic objects

 pkcs15-init --erase-card

This may result in a error if the card is already blank. With the next command a
fresh PKCS#15 file structure is created on a smart card or crypto token:
----
pkcs15-init  --create-pkcs15 --profile pkcs15+onepin \
             --use-default-transport-key \
             --pin 0000 --puk 111111 \
             --label "Test"
----
A secret PIN code is stored in an irretrievable location on the smart card. The PIN
will protect the signing operation. If the PIN is entered incorrectly more than
three times then the smart card will be locked and the PUK code can be used to
unlock the card again.

Next the private key is transferred to the smart card

 pkcs15-init --auth-id 1 [--id 45] --store-private-key myKey.pem

By default the PKCS#15 smart card record will be assigned the ID `*0x45*`. Using
the `*--id*` option, multiple key records can be stored on a smart card.

At last we load the matching X.509 certificate onto the smart card

 pkcs15-init --auth-id 1 [--id 45] --store-certificate myCert.pem

The `*pkcs15-tool*` can now be used to verify the contents of the smart card.

 pkcs15-tool --list-pins --list-keys --list-certificates

== strongSwan Configuration

=== pkcs11 Plugin

To use smart cards with strongSwan the xref:plugins/pkcs11.adoc[`*pkcs11*`] plugin
has to be enabled and configured.

Next the PKCS#11 library provided by {OPENSC}["OpenSC] has to be configured in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`].
----
  pkcs11 {
    modules {
      opensc {
        path = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so
      }
    }
  }
----

=== Entering the PIN Code

Since the smart card signing operation needed during authentication is protected
by a PIN code, the secret PIN must be made available to the IKE daemon via a
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_secrets_tokensuffix[`*secrets.token<suffix>*`]
subsection in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]

[{COLS}]
|===
|Key |Default| Description

include::partial$config/swanctl-secrets-token.adoc[]
|===

For gateways that must be able to start IPsec tunnels automatically in unattended
mode after a reboot, the secret PIN can be stored statically, as in
----
secrets {
  token-gw {
    handle = 45
    pin = "12345678"
  }
}
----
On a personal notebook computer that could get stolen, you wouldn't want to store
 your PIN in in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. Thus just omit
 the `*pin*` attribute as in
secrets {
  token1 {
    handle = 45
  }
}
Using the xref:swanctl/swanctlLoadCreds.adoc[`*swanctl --load-creds*`] on the
command line before starting the IPsec connection will prompt you for the PIN.

=== Configuring Certificates and Connections

The xref:plugins/pkcs11.adoc[`*pkcs11*`] plugin will automatically load all
certificates from the smart card when the daemon initializes it. CA certificates
are also automatically available as trust anchors without the need to copy them
into the xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*/etc/swanctl/x509ca*`] directory first.

Therefore it is usually not necessary to configure a `*local.cert*` subsection in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`], instead `*local.id*` is configured
to either the `*subjectDistinguishedName*` or one of the `*subjectAltNames*`
contained in the certificate.

For instance if `*\alice@strongswan.org*` is contained in the certificate as a
`*subjectAltName*` extension, simply configure

 connections.<conn>.left.id = alice@strongswan.org

In situations where multiple certificates match the same identity configuring a
`*local.cert<suffix>*` subsection might be necessary

[{COLS}]
|===
|Key |Default| Description

include::partial$config/swanctl-local-cert.adoc[]
|===

This can be the case with some eID cards that contain separate signature and
encryption certificates with the same identities. Thus for instance
----
  local {
    ...
    cert-50 {
      handle = 50
    }
  }
----
will look in all available modules and slots for ID `*0x50*` starting with the
first slot whereas
----
  local {
    ...
    cert-50 {
      slot = 4
      handle = 50
    }
  }
----
will directly check slot `*4*` (which is usually the first slot on the second
reader/token when using the OpenSC library) for a key with ID `*0x50*`.
