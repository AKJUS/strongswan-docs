== IKE Support Options

The single-character options in the list below are used throughout this document
to designate the third-party crypto libraries and/or the default strongSwan
plugins that support a given crypto algorithm used by the IKE protocol.

Algorithms designated by *s* are strongly deprecated because they have become
cryptographically *weak* and thus prone to attacks.

== Authenticated Encryption (AEAD) Algorithms

AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) algorithms can't be combined
with classic encryption ciphers in the same proposal. No separate integrity algorithm
must be proposed and therefore Pseudo-Random Functions (PRFs) have to be included
explicitly in such proposals.

It's also possible to use the hash implementations provided by the `*gcrypt*` plugin
together with the `*hmac*` plugin.

== Pseudo-Random Functions

PRF algorithms can optionally be defined in IKEv2 proposals. In earlier releases
or if no pseudo-random functions are configured, the proposed integrity algorithms
are mapped to pseudo-random functions.

If AEAD ciphers are proposed there won't be any integrity algorithms from which
to derive PRFs. Thus PRF algorithms have to be configured explicitly.

It's also possible to use the hashers provided by the `*gcrypt*` plugin together
with the `*hmac*` plugin.

=== Key Derivation Functions

Based on the negotiated PRF, IKEv2 derives key material in two separate steps
(PRF/prf+). Since strongSwan 5.9.6, these are provided by plugins.

|SHA2_512 PRF
|x b w o       |sha2, hmac, kdf
|===

The `*botan*`, `*openssl*` and `*wolfssl*` plugins implement HMAC-based KDFs
directly via their respective {IETF}/rfc5869[HKDF (RFC 5869)] implementation.

The `*kdf*` plugin provides generic wrappers for any supported generic PRF.

== Key Exchange Methods

[TIP]
.Using Multiple Key Exchanges
====
With peers that support multiple IKEv2 key exchanges ({RFC9370}[RFC 9370]), up to seven
*additional key exchanges* may be negotiated. They can be configured by prefixing
the algorithm keyword with `*keX_*` (where `*X*` is a number between 1 and 7).
So a total of eight key exchanges may be used for each SA.

For example, `*x25519-ke1_mlkem786*` adds ML-KEM-786 as additional key
exchange method after the initial key exchange with X25519. This works with any
key exchange method, whether post-quantum or classic Diffie-Hellman.

As with any algorithm in proposals, peers have to agree on a KE method for each
round unless no algorithms are defined by both or `*keX_none*` is configured to
make a particular round explicitly *optional* (there can be gaps, so it's
technically fine to negotiate e.g. `*x25519-ke7_mlkem786*`).

== Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite

The *Suite B* cryptographic suites for IPsec ({RFC6379}[RFC 6379]) have been
superseded by the {CNSA}[Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite] (CNSA) suite
which basically deprecates the 128-bit suite defined by Suite B. Its recommendations
regarding algorithm parameters are as follows:

Encryption ::
  AES with 256-bit key length (*aes256gcm16* or *aes256*)

Key Exchange ::
  ECDH with NIST P-384 curve (*ecp384*) +
  DH with at least 3072-bit modulus (*modp3072* or higher)

Pseudo-Random Function/Integrity Protection ::
  SHA-384 (e.g. *prfsha384* or *sha384* if not using AES in GCM mode)

Digital Signatures ::
  ECDSA with NIST P-384 curve +
  RSA with at least 3072-bit modulus

== Deprecated NSA Suite B

strongSwan does not provide direct keywords to configure the deprecated Suite B
cryptographic suites defined in {RFC6379}[RFC 6379] whose status was set to *historic*
in 2018. But Suite B algorithms may be configured explicitly using the following
proposal strings (if supported by plugins and IPsec implementation):

=== ESP Integrity Protection and Confidentiality

Suite-B-GCM-128 ::
  IKE: aes128gcm16-prfsha256-ecp256 +
  ESP: aes128gcm16-ecp256

Suite-B-GCM-256 ::
  IKE: aes256gcm16-prfsha384-ecp384 +
  ESP: aes256gcm16-ecp384

=== ESP Integrity Protection Only

Suite-B-GMAC-128 ::
  IKE: aes128-sha256-ecp256 +
  ESP: aes128gmac-ecp256 +

Suite-B-GMAC-256 ::
  IKE: aes256-sha384-ecp384 +
  ESP: aes256gmac-ecp384

The proposal strings above enable PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy). Omit the DH groups
in the ESP proposals to disable PFS or configure two proposals, one with and one
without DH group in order to let the peer decide whether PFS is used. This is what
the xref:os/androidVpnClient.adoc[strongSwan Android VPN client] implements in its
default ESP proposals.
