= Integrity Measurement Architecture

:IMA: https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/

The Linux {IMA}[Integrity Measurement Architecture] (IMA) maintains a runtime
measurement list and, if anchored in a hardware
xref:tpm/tpm2.adoc[Trusted Platform Module] (TPM), an aggregate integrity value
over this list. The benefit of anchoring the aggregate integrity value in the TPM
is that the measurement list cannot be compromised by any software attack without
being detectable. Hence on a trusted boot system, IMA can be used to attest the
system's runtime integrity.

=== TPM BIOS/IMA Measurements and SW ID Subscription Policy

In order to enable `BIOS` and `IMA` measurements, add the `*TPM BIOS/IMA*` group
in the *Device Info* menu for a given device.

Since `IMA` measurements needs current file reference hashes, the
`*SW ID Subscription Policy*` is added via a special `*PT-TLS*` group.

Additionally set the *Trusted* flag in order to put trust into the *Attestation Key*
sent by the endpoint via the PA-TNC protocol. The *Device ID* is the `*keyid*` of
the AK, so that the correctness of the public key can be verified.

=== Device Report

The session details of the device report show that 26 SW ID events, 1732 IMA
measurements and 136 BIOS measurements were received and successfully verified.

=== TPM Evidence

The TPM Evidence consists of 136 BIOS Measurements extended to PCR registers
`*0..9*` and `*14*`

At the very end of the evidence list is the *boot aggregate* (SHA256 hash of the
concatenated SHA256 hashes of the final state of PCRs `*0..9*` which is the first
value that is extended into PCR `*10*`)

== IMA Client

The xref:./imaClient.adoc[IMA Client] is the TNC component located on the client
side, retrieving and transmitting the TPM BIOS and IMA evidence measurements and
updating the file hashes via the `*collector.db*` database.

== IMA Server

The xref:./imaServer.adoc[IMA Server] is the TNC component running on the server
side, receiving the TPM BIOS evidence measurements and storing or verifying them in
the xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC] database. The received IMA evidence measurements
are compared with the reference file hashes stored in the
xref:./strongTnc.adoc[strongTNC] database that are periodically updated.
