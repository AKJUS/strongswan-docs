= counters Plugin

== Purpose

The `*counters*` plugin for `*libcharon*` collects and provides several IKE
statistics counters. The counter values can be queried or reset (globally or per
connection name) via the xref:swanctl/swanctlCounters.adoc[`*swanctl --counters*`]
subcommand.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-counters

== Available Counters

Counters are collected globally and per connection name. However, the latter
category has some limitations e.g. if the initially selected connection is
switched due to the authentication method or the exchanged identities. In which
case e.g. no `IKE_SA_INIT` messages will be recorded for the name of the second
connection. Also some counters will never record connection specific numbers
(e.g. the number of messages with invalid `IKE SPI`).
