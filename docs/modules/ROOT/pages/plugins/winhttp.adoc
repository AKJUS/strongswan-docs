= winhttp Plugin

== Purpose

The `*winhttp*` plugin for `*libstrongswan*` is a CRL/OCSP fetcher plugin used
with the xref:os/windows.adoc[Windows] platform. It supports fetching of `CRL`
or `OCSP` information over `HTTP` or `HTTPS` URLs using the native `WinHTTP` API.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-winhttp

As `MinGW` usually does not come with a `*libwinhttp.dll*`, use a copy of
`*winhttp.dll*` from `Windows\System32` for a cross-platform build.
