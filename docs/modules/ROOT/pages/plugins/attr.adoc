= attr Plugin

:IANA: https://www.iana.org/assignments/ikev2-parameters/ikev2-parameters.xhtml#ikev2-parameters-21

== Purpose

The `*attr*` plugin for `*libcharon*` provides IKE attributes configured in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[strongswan.conf] to peers.
It is enabled by default but may be disabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --disable-attr

== Behavior

Configured attributes are assigned to peers via `CP` configuration payloads (IKEv2)
or via Mode Config (IKEv1). Attributes are only assigned to peers if they
request a xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP address].

== Configuration

The `*attr*` plugin is configured using the following options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_attr[`*charon.plugins.attr*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

=== Attribute Types

Possible values for `*<attribute*` are listed in the following table. Depending
on the address family of the IP address specified as value the proper `IP4` or
`IP6` attribute type is used. A complete list of IKEv2 configuration payload
(`CP`) attributes can be found on the {IANA}[IANA] website. Multiple values can
be specified as a comma-separated list.

==== IPv4 Attributes

[cols="2,4,1,8"]
|===
|Key          |Attribute Type      |Code |Description

|address      |INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS|1
|Internal IPv4 address

|netmask      |INTERNAL_IP4_NETMASK|2
|Netmask of the internal network (in dotted decimal notation), similar to
 `*subnet*` but bound to the internal address

|dns          |INTERNAL_IP4_DNS    |3
|DNS server

|nbns         |INTERNAL_IP4_NBNS   |4
|WINS server

|dhcp         |INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP   |6
|DHCP server

|subnet       |INTERNAL_IP4_SUBNET |13
|The protected sub-networks that this edge-device protects (in `CIDR` notation).
 Usually ignored in deference to `*local_ts*`, though macOS clients will use
 this for routes

|p-cscf       |P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS |20
|P-CSCF server (IKEv2 only)
|===

==== IPv6 Attributes

[cols="2,4,1,8"]

|address      |INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS|8
|Internal IPv6 address

|netmask      |INTERNAL_IP6_NETMASK|9
|Netmask of the internal network (IKEv1 only)

|dns          |INTERNAL_IP6_DNS    |10
|DNS server

|p-cscf       |P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS |21
|P-CSCF server (IKEv2 only)
|===

==== Miscellaneous IANA Attributes

The configured attribute type `*<integer code>*` as assigned by {IANA}[IANA].
The value as defined by the referenced RFCs (see following examples),
IP addresses and subnets are recognized, otherwise the literal string is used as
the attribute value.

[cols="2,4,1,8"]
|===
|Key          |Attribute Type      |Code |Description

|7            |APPLICATION_VERSION |7
|String of printable ASCII characters that signifies the version or application
 of the IPsec host

|18           |INTERNAL_IP6_PREFIX |18
|Subnet passed to the clients as prefix

==== Cisco Unity extensions for IKEv1 (IPv4 and IPv6)

[cols="2,4,1,8"]
|===
|Key          |Attribute Type      |Code |Description

|28672        |UNITY_BANNER        |28672
|Message displayed on certain clients after login

|28673        |UNITY_SAVE_PASSWD   |28673
|Allow client to save Xauth password in local storage

|28674        |UNITY_DEF_DOMAIN    |28674
|Default search domain used when resolving host names via the assigned DNS servers

|28675        |UNITY_SPLITDNS_NAME |28675
|If split tunneling is used clients might not install the assigned DNS servers
 globally. This space-separated list of domain names allows clients, such as
 macOS, to selectively query the assigned DNS servers. Seems Mac OS X uses
 only the first item in the list

|split-include|UNITY_SPLIT_INCLUDE |28676
|Comma-separated list of subnets to tunnel. The xref:plugins/unity.adoc[unity]
 plugin provides a connection specific approach to assign this attribute

|28677        |UNITY_NATT_PORT     |28677
|

|split-exclude|UNITY_LOCAL_LAN     |28678
|Comma-separated list of subnets not to tunnel

|28679        |UNITY_PFS           |28679

=== Legacy Options

[cols="4,1,8"]
|===
|Key|Default|Description

|charon.dns1  |
|DNS server 1 assigned to peer via `CP` configuration payload

|charon.dns2  |
|DNS server 2 assigned to peer via `CP` configuration payload

|charon.nbns1 |
|WINS server 1 assigned to peer via `CP` configuration payload

|charon.nbns2 |
|WINS server 2 assigned to peer via `CP` configuration payload
|===

== Example

----
# the following assigns two DNS servers to peers
charon {
    plugins {
        attr {
            dns = 10.0.10.10, 10.0.20.10
        }
    }
}

# this is the same using the legacy options
charon {
    dns1 = 10.0.10.10
    dns2 = 10.0.20.10
}
