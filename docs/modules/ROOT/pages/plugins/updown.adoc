= updown Plugin

== Purpose

The `*updown*` plugin for `*libcharon*` invokes a script when an IKEv2 `CHILD SA`
or an IKEv1 `Quick Mode` gets established or deleted.

The plugin is enabled by default, but can be disabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --disable-updown

A default `*_updown*` script is installed in `IPSECDIR`, which defaults to
`LIBEXECDIR/ipsec` (see xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] for details).
For instance, on Debian/Ubuntu, the script is located at `/usr/lib/ipsec/_updown`.

== Configuration

To invoke the default `*_updown*` script with
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] pass the absolute path to it in

 connections.<conn>.children.<child>.updown

and add the `*iptables*` argument so that the default behavior is triggered, e.g.

 updown = /usr/libexec/ipsec/_updown iptables

The default `*_updown*` script installs `*ACCEPT*` Netfilter rules in the Linux
kernel by invoking `*iptables*` for the established traffic selectors, allowing
default `*DROP*` policies. If the local traffic selector is not a single host
then the option

  connections.<conn>.children.<child>.hostaccess = yes

in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] inserts rules in the `INPUT`
and `OUTPUT` chains, besides the rules in the `FORWARD` chain, that allow
accessing the VPN server itself. Please refer to the `*_updown*` script for
details.

Alternatively, an arbitrary script with optional arguments can be configured
via the `*updown*` attribute in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]
to install custom firewall rules or perform other actions.

== Behavior

The plugin allows the invocation of custom commands associated with `CHILD SA up`
and `CHILD SA down` events. The script is compatible to the `*_updown*` script
originally used by the `*pluto*` IKEv1 daemon.

=== Updown Script Interface

The following `PLUTO` environment variables are passed to the `*_updown*` script:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
|Variable | Description

|PLUTO_VERSION
|indicates what version of this interface is being used. This document describes
 version 1.1 which is upwardly compatible with version 1.0

|PLUTO_VERB
|specifies the name of the operation to be performed (`up-host`, `up-client`,
 `down-host`, or `down-client`). If the address family for security gateway to
 security gateway communications is IPv6, then a suffix of -v6 is added to the
 verb

|PLUTO_CONNECTION
|is the name of the connection for which we are routing

|PLUTO_INTERFACE
|is the name of the ipsec interface to be used

|PLUTO_REQID
|is the reqid of the ESP or AH policy

|PLUTO_PROTO
|is the negotiated IPsec protocol, `ah` or `esp`

|PLUTO_IPCOMP
|is not empty if IPComp was negotiated

|PLUTO_UNIQUEID
|is the unique identifier of the associated IKE_SA

|PLUTO_ME
|is the IP address of our host.

|PLUTO_MY_ID
|is the ID of our host.

|PLUTO_MY_CLIENT
|is the IP address/netmask in CIDR format of our client subnet.  If the client
 is just the host, this will be the host's own IP address/max (where max is 32
 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6)

|PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP
|is a legacy variable and equals the first virtual IP (either IPv4 or IPv6)

|PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP4_$i
|contains a IPv4 virtual IP received from a responder where $i enumerates from 1
 to the number of IPs per address family

|PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP6_$i
|contains a IPv6 virtual IP received from a responder where $i enumerates from 1
 to the number of IPs per address family

|PLUTO_MY_PROTOCOL
|is the IP protocol that will be transported

|PLUTO_MY_PORT
|is the UDP/TCP port to which the IPsec SA is restricted on our side. For
 ICMP/ICMPv6 this contains the message type and PLUTO_PEER_PORT the message code

|PLUTO_PEER
|is the IP address of our peer

|PLUTO_PEER_ID
|is the ID of our peer

|PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT
|is the IP address/netmask in CIDR format of the peer's client subnet. If the
 client is just the peer, this will be the peer's own IP address/max (where max
 is 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).

|PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP
|is a legacy variable and equals the first virtual IP (either IPv4 or IPv6)

|PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP4_$i
|contains a IPv4 virtual IP sent to an initiator where $i enumerates from 1 to
 the number of IPs per address family

|PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP6_$i
|contains a IPv6 virtual IP sent to an initiator where $i enumerates from 1 to
 the number of IPs per address family

|PLUTO_PEER_PROTOCOL
|is the IP protocol that will be transported

|PLUTO_PEER_PORT
|is the UDP/TCP port to which the IPsec SA is restricted on the peer side. For
 ICMP/ICMPv6 this contains the message code and PLUTO_MY_PORT the message type

|PLUTO_XAUTH_ID
|is an optional user ID employed by the XAUTH protocol

|PLUTO_MARK_IN
|is an optional XFRM mark set on the inbound IPsec SA

|PLUTO_MARK_OUT
|is an optional XFRM mark set on the outbound IPsec SA

|PLUTO_IF_ID_IN
|is an optional XFRM interface ID set on the inbound IPsec SA

|PLUTO_IF_ID_OUT
|is an optional XFRM interface ID set on the outbound IPsec SA

|PLUTO_UDP_ENC
|contains the remote UDP port in the case of ESP_IN_UDP encapsulation

|PLUTO_DNS4_$i
|contains an IPv4 DNS server attribute received from a responder, $i enumerates
 from 1 to the number of servers per address family

|PLUTO_DNS6_$i
|contains an IPv6 DNS server attribute received from a responder, $i enumerates
 from 1 to the number of servers per address family
|===

=== Updown Events

The `*updown*` plugin invokes the script hook with the following `*PLUTO_VERB*`
values:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
|PLUTO_VERB | Description

|up-host
|`CHILD SA up` event, where the negotiated local traffic selector is a single
 IPv4 host

|up-host-v6
|`CHILD SA up` event, where the negotiated local traffic selector is a single
 IPv6 host

|up-client
|`CHILD_SA up` event, where the negotiated local traffic selector is an
 IPv4 subnet

|up-client-v6
|`CHILD_SA up` event, where the negotiated local traffic selector is an
 IPv6 subnet

|down-host
|`CHILD_SA down` event, counterpart of up-host

|down-host-v6
|`CHILD_SA down` event, counterpart of up-host-v6

|down-client
|`CHILD_SA down` event, counterpart of up-client

|down-client-v6
|`CHILD_SA down` event, counterpart of up-client-v6
|===

CAUTION: While Child SA rekeying establishes a new Child SA, the hooks do
not get invoked.

NOTE: With IKEv2, a Child SA's traffic selectors may contain multiple hosts
or subnets. To keep compatibility with scripts originally designed for IKEv1,
the script is invoked for each combination of local and remote traffic selectors.
This means that if there is more than one traffic selector, the *script is
called multiple times* when a Child SA is established/closed.

== Logging

The default _updown_ script additionally logs the `CHILD SA` event to `*syslog*`.
This behavior can be disabled by commenting out the `*VPN_LOGGING*` option in
the script.

== Alternatives

The `*updown*` script allows the installation of custom `*iptables*`rules and
often it is very simple to implement custom logic. It has, however, some
limitations for historical reasons and might not scale with a lot of tunnels.

To accept traffic with default `DROP` policies, one may alternatively use global,
non-tunnel specific rules matching IPsec traffic with the Netfilter `*policy*`
match.

The xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*` plugin] provides various asynchronous events
that may be used to trigger external actions or run scripts. Unlike the `*updown*`
script, its `*child-updown*` event is only triggered once per Child SA, not
for each combination of local and remote traffic selectors. And additional events
are triggered for IKE SAs or for rekeyings of SAs. Handling `*vici*` events also
doesn't block the IKE daemon's message bus, which running the `*updown*` script
currently does.
