:EX:    {TESTS}/ikev2/forecast

== Purpose

The `*forecast*` plugin for `*libcharon*` uses Linux Netfilter marks to allow
identical IPsec policies having multicast or broadcast selectors and uses a
listen-and-forward mechanism to forward such traffic over all matching SAs. It
supports forwarding of multi/broadcast traffic between multiple connected clients
and between clients and a LAN attached to the IPsec gateway.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-forecast

Building the plugin requires `*iptables*` development headers to be installed.

== Configuration

The `*forecast*` plugin currently is used on any SA negotiated that uses a
unique mark. To configure such a connection as responder, set a unique mark and
don't forget to include the broadcast/multicast selectors that you want to forward:
----
connections {

  mc-bc {
    # ...
    children {
      mc-bc {
        local_ts  = 10.1.0.0/16,224.0.0.0/4
        remote_ts = dynamic,224.0.0.0/4,10.1.255.255
        mark = %unique
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The `*local_ts*` shall include the local network and any multicast address to
tunnel but can also be `*0.0.0.0/0*`. The `*remote_ts*` can include multicast
addresses as well and the required broadcast addresses. Don't forget to include
the default `*dynamic*` selector if a virtual IP address is assigned to the client.

A unique mark per negotiated SA is required, so the SAs can be distinguished.
The plugin automatically configures Netfilter rules in the `*mangle*` table to
send multicast/broadcast packets over multiple SAs.

Some additional global xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
options are used by the `*forecast*` plugin:

[cols="1,3"]
|===

|charon.plugins.forecast.groups
|224.0.0.1,224.0.0.22,224.0.0.251,224.0.0.252,239.255.255.250
|===

_Comma-separated list of multicast groups to join locally. The local host receives
and forwards packets in the local LAN for joined multicast groups only. Packets
matching the list of multicast groups get forwarded to connected clients. The
default group includes host multicasts, IGMP, mDNS, LLMNR and SSDP/WS-Discovery
and is usually a good choice for Windows clients._

[cols="1,3"]

|charon.plugins.forecast.interface
|
|===

_Name of the local interface to listen for broadcasts messages to forward. If no
interface is configured, the first usable interface is used, which is usually
just fine for single-homed hosts. If your host has multiple interfaces, set this
option to the local LAN interface you want to forward broadcasts from/to._

[cols="1,3"]
|===

|charon.plugins.forecast.reinject
|
|===

_Comma-separated list of `CHILD SA` configuration names for which to perform
multi/broadcast reinjection. For clients connecting over such a configuration,
any multi/broadcast received over the tunnel gets reinjected to all active tunnels.
This makes the broadcasts visible to other peers, and for examples allows clients
to see others shares. If disabled, multi/broadcast messages received over a tunnel
are injected to the local network only, but not to other IPsec clients._

== Netfilter Rules and Marks

In `PREROUTING` a gateway applies the unique mark assigned to the SA to the
packet. This makes sure the IPsec policy actually matches, as we require the
correct mark for a policy match. For non-NAT situations, ESP matching is used to
`*MARK*` packets, for NAT situations the packets get selected based on UDP
encapsulation ports.

Additionally, `PREROUTING` rules get installed to set the mark on decapsulated
traffic matching any policy.

On the `OUTPUT` chain, the `*MARK*` target is used to set the mark to match the
appropriate IPsec policy.

The rules installed by the plugin for two clients looks something like:
----
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 55 packets, 8648 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination
    1   112 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.130   MARK set 0x2
    3   488 MARK    esp  --  *  *    192.168.0.200   192.168.0.1  esp spi:3242273483 MARK set 0x2
    1   112 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.129   MARK set 0x1
    3   488 MAR     esp  --  *  *    192.168.0.100   192.168.0.1  esp spi:3416575175 MARK set 0x1

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 50 packets, 8172 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 65 packets, 10840 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination
    0     0 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.130   MARK set 0x2
    0     0 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.129   MARK set 0x1
----

In certain situations (e.g. if there is NAT on the host itself), it might be
necessary to manually add rules that use the `*CONNMARK*` target to properly
mark return traffic.
