== Purpose

The `*tnc-ifmap*` plugin for `*libcharon*` enables a strongSwan VPN gateway to
act as a Metadata Access Point (MAP) Client sending its
{MAP_META}[Network Security Metadata] via the SOAP 1.2 based TNC
{MAP_IF}[IF-MAP 2.2] interface to a MAP Server.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-tnc-ifmap

== Configuration

The `*tnc-ifmap*` plugin is configured using the options defined in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_tnc_ifmap[`*charon.plugins.tnc-ifmap*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`].

=== TLS Options

The `*tnc-ifmap*` plugin uses the strongSwan `*libtls*` library that can be
configured and fine-tuned with the following xref:config/tlsOptions.adoc[TLS options].

=== Examples

==== MAP Client with Public Key Authentication
----
charon {
  plugins {
    tnc-ifmap {
      device_name = strongswan-gw
      server_uri = \https://localhost:8444/
      server_cert = /etc/swanctl/x509/server.pem
      client_cert = /etc/swanctl/x509/client.pem
      client_key  = /etc/swanctl/rsa/client_key_file.pem
    }
  }
}
----

==== MAP Client with HTTP Basic Authentication
----
charon {
  plugins {
    tnc-ifmap {
      device_name = strongswan-gw
      server_uri = \https://localhost:8443/
      server_cert = /etc/swanctl/x509/server.pem
      username_password = strongswan:strongswan
    }
  }
}
----

== Metadata

Currently a strongSwan VPN gateway acting as a Police Enforcement Point (PEP)
and additionally as a Policy Decision Point (PDP) provides the following
metadata to a MAP server:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Metadata|Description

|device-ip
|All IPv4 and IPv6 network interfaces the IPsec PEP listens on

|access-request-ip
|The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the remote access peer

|authenticated-as
|Identity of the remote access peer

|authenticated-by
|Device name of the PDP authenticating the remote access peer

|capability
|Group memberships of the remote access peer (assigned by RADIUS or TNCS)

|enforcement-report
|Report failed authentication of a remote access peer
|===

== Visualization

The strongSwan MAP client sends its {MAP_META}[metadata] via the TNC
{MAP_IF}[IF-MAP 2.2] interface to an {HSH}/irond[`*irond*`] MAP server. The
{HSH}/irongui[`*irongui*`] MAP client is attached to the {HSH}/irond[`*irond*`]
MAP server and visualizes the collected metadata.
