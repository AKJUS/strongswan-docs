= socket-win Plugin

== Purpose

The `*socket-win*` pluginfor `*libcharon*`  is a replacement for `*socket-default*`
on the xref:os/windows.adoc[Windows] platform. It provides an IPv4/IPv6 IKE socket
backend based on the Winsock2 API.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-socket-win

== Behavior

The plugin opens two IPv4/IPv6 dual protocol sockets for both IKE ports 500 and
4500. Custom ports can be specified using the `*charon-svc.port*` and
`*charon-svc.port_nat_t`* xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
options. `*charon-svc.max_packet*` configures the maximum IKE packet size.

== Port Conflicts with IKEEXT Service

When using the default ports, the plugin conflicts with the Windows _IKE and
AuthIP IPsec Keying Module_ service `IKEEXT`. The service has to be stopped and
disabled to properly receive IKE packets in strongSwan.
