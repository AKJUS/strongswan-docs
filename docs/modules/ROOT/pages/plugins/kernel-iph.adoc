= kernel-iph Plugin

== Purpose

The `*kernel-iph*` plugin for `*libcharon*` is a networking backend for the
xref:os/windows.adoc[Windows] platform using the IPHelper API family. It provides
address and routing lookup functionality and installs routes for IPsec traffic.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-kernel-iph

== Behavior

When installing routes for IPsec policies, the backend implicitly enables IP
forwarding in the Windows kernel.

== Limitations

The backend does not support installation of xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP]
addresses for IPsec clients. Further, routes get installed to the main routing
table, hence IPsec routes can not be excluded from routing lookups for IKE traffic.
