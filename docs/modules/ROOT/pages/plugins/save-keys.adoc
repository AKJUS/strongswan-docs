= save-keys Plugin

:WIRESHARK: https://www.wireshark.org/

== Purpose

The `*save-keys*` plugin for `*libcharon*` automatically stores secret ESP and
IKEv2 or IKEv1 session keys in {WIRESHARK}[Wireshark] format to the default files
`*esp_sa*`, `*ike2_decryption_table*` or `*ikev1_decryption_table*`, respectively.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-save-keys


WARNING: *Never* load the `*save-keys*` plugin and enable IKE and/or ESP secret
         session key storage on *production systems*, since this severely
         compromises the security of your IPSec-based communication channels.

== Configuration

The `*save-keys*` plugin is configured using the following options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_save_keys[`*charon.plugins.save-keys*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

== Example

=== strongSwan Setup

In the xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] configuration file on
the VPN gateway `*moon*` we activate  the automatic storage of all IKE and ESP keys
to the `*/root/.config/wireshark*` directory where `*wireshark*` run as `*root*`
on Linux expects its decryption keys
----
charon-systemd {
  plugins {
    save-keys {
      esp = yes
      ike = yes
      wireshark_keys = /root/.config/wireshark
    }
  }
}
----

NOTE: When the xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc[`*charon-systemd*`] daemon is
      started with `*systemctl start strongswan*`, the log contains a warning that
      secret IKE and ESP keys are being permanently stored in the
      `*root/.config/wireshark*` directory.

=== Wireshark Setup

We start `*wireshark*` as `*root*` on the `*moon-eth0*` interface with the
capture filter

  proto 50 or port 500 or port 4500

and then we initiate an IPsec tunnel to VPN gateway `*sun*` and ping the host
`*bob*` behind the gateway `*sun*` twice
----
# ping -c 2 -p deadbeef 10.2.0.10
PATTERN: 0xdeadbeef
PING bob.strongswan.org (10.2.0.10) 56(84) bytes of data.

64 bytes from bob.strongswan.org (10.2.0.10): icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=1.83 ms
----
The following `*wireshark*` trace results

image::wiresharkRaw.png[Encrypted wireshark trace, link=self]

We enable the decoding of encrypted ESP payloads in the Wireshark
`*Edit/Preferences/Protocols/ESP*` menu

image::wiresharkDecrypt.png[Enable ESP decryption, 550, 427, link=self]

Finally we store the captured `*wireshark*` trace under the file name `*moon.pcapng*`.

=== Wireshark Decryption Keys

The same information, namely that an IKEv2 negotiation took place and two
ESP-encrypted pings went through the IPsec tunnel is shown by the
xref:swanctl/swanctlListSas.adoc[`*swanctl --list-sas*`] command

=== Decrypted Wireshark Trace

Exit `*wireshark*` and restart the program loading the stored `*moon.pcapng*`
trace.  The ESP packets are automatically decrypted using the `*esp_sa*` decryption
table, so that the `*deadbeef*` ICMP request is displayed as plaintext.

Also the `IKE_AUTH` request and response packets are decrypted usig the
`*ikev2_decryption_table*`, so that the various IKEv2 payloads contained in
the `*Encrypted Data*` IKEv2 payload can be browsed in plaintext
