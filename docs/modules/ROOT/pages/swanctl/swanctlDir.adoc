= swanctl Directory

The `*swanctl*` configuration directory (usually `*/etc/swanctl*`) contains
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] and a predefined set of
sub-directories that provide file-based credentials such as private keys and
certificates that are read by the
xref:swanctl/swanctlLoadCreds.adoc[`*swanctl --load-creds*`] command.

Since version 5.7.2 these directories are accessed relative to the loaded
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] file (in particular when
loading it from a custom location via the `*--file*` option supported by the
xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc[`*swanctl --load-...*`] commands. The location of the
`*swanctl*` directory may also be specified at runtime via the `*SWANCTL_DIR*`
environment variable.

Each sub-directory is used for a specific kind of credential:
