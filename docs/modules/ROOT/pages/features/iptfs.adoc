{RFC9347}[RFC 9347] defines a new Aggregation and Fragmentation Mode (AGGFRAG)
for ESP and its use for IP Traffic Flow Security (IP-TFS).

This new *AGGFRAG* mode *is like tunnel mode*. But it provides facilities to
*aggregate smaller IP packets* into a single AGGFRAG payload that's sent in
one ESP packet, as well as *fragment large IP packets* into multiple AGGFRAG
payloads that are sent in separate ESP packets.

On top of that, *IP-TFS* adds Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) by *obscuring the
size and frequency* of IP traffic through *fixed-size ESP packets sent at a
constant rate*. Compared to the classic TFC feature provided by ESP, which pads
ESP packets containing a single IP packet (or just padding) to a fixed size,
AGGFRAG adds the advantage that these fixed-size ESP packets may contain partial,
whole, or multiple IP packets to maximize the bandwidth of the IPsec tunnel.

IMPORTANT: The Linux kernel *supports the AGGFRAG mode* since 6.14, strongSwan
supports it since version 6.0.2. However, the Linux kernel currently only
implements the basic aggregation and fragmentation features of the new mode.
*IP-TFS is not yet supported.*

== Configuration

To enable AGGFRAG mode in strongSwan, configure
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_connections_conn_children_child_mode[`*<child>.mode = iptfs*`].
Currently, this mode is not enforced. So if the peer doesn't support it, there
is an automatic fallback to tunnel mode.

NOTE: This mode can't be combined with IP compression (IPComp)
(xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_connections_conn_children_child_ipcomp[`*<child>.ipcomp*`])
or the classic TFC padding
(xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_connections_conn_children_child_tfc_padding[`*<child>.tfc_padding*`]).

There are several global settings related to IP-TFS/AGGFRAG configurable in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]. They are located in
the `*charon.iptfs*` section. Note that some settings apply only to *inbound*
traffic (received/decrypted), while others apply only to *outbound* traffic (plaintext
to be sent encrypted).

3+h|charon.iptfs

|drop_time                                     |1000000
|Time in microseconds to wait for out-of-order packets when processing *inbound*
 traffic (default 1 second)

|reorder_window                                |3
|Number of packets that may arrive out of order when processing *inbound* traffic

|init_delay                                    |0
|Time in microseconds to wait for subsequent packets to aggregate together
 when sending *outbound* traffic. Only relevant if no packets are already
 queued to be sent

|max_queue_size                                |1048576
|Maximum number of bytes allowed to be queued for *sending* on the tunnel
 (default 1 MiB). If the queue is full, packets are dropped

|packet_size                                   |0
|Maximum outer packet size (layer 3) when *sending* packets. The default of 0
 will use the PMTU as packet size. *Note that the kernel currently doesn't
 pad smaller packets*

|accept_fragments                              |yes
|Whether fragments of inner packets across multiple AGGFRAG payloads are
 *accepted*. This is an IKEv2 option, so if the peer doesn't adhere to this
 request and still sends such fragments, they will be processed by the kernel

|dont_frag                                     |no
|Force disabling fragmenting inner packets across multiple AGGFRAG payloads
 when *sending* outbound traffic (fragmentation is automatically disabled if
 the peer indicates that it doesn't support handling such packets)

== Example


.strongSwan {EX}[example] showing the aggregation of IP packets into a single ESP packet
image::a-m-w-s-b.png[topology,501,190,link={EX}]


The {EX}[net2net-iptfs test scenario] shows an example of aggregating multiple
small packets into a single ESP packet. Gateway `*moon*` has an AGGFRAG mode SA
negotiated with gateway `*sun*`. It also has `*init_delay*` configured to wait
longer for packets to aggregate. When host `*alice*` sends four pings to `*bob*`
in short succession, all four ICMP requests are aggregated into a single ESP
packet. Because the requests are decrypted and forwarded basically as one by
gateway `*sun*`, the responses then arrive so close together that they are again
aggregated into single ESP packet, even without having configured an explicit
`*init_delay*` on `*sun*`.
