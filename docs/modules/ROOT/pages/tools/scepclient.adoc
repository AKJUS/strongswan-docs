== Description

The `*scepclient*` tool is a client implementation of the _Simple Certificate
Enrollment Protocol_ (SCEP).

NOTE: This tool was written in 2005 and only got marginal updates since then.
      Hence it implements an old version of the SCEP Internet Draft (version
      10/11 of {IDSCEP}[draft-nourse-scep]). The new SCEP {RFC8894}[RFC 8894] was
      released in September 2020, so the tool might not be compatible with newer
      SCEP servers. It also uses default algorithms that are really not
      state-of-the-art anymore (e.g. `MD5` to hash/sign and single `DES` to
      encrypt).
