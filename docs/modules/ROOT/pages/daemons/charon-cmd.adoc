== Synopsis

 charon-cmd --host <hostname> --identity <id> [options]

== Description

`*charon-cmd*` is a command-line program for setting up IPsec VPN connections
using the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) in version 1 and 2. It supports a
number of different road-warrior scenarios. Like the IKE `*charon*` daemon,
`*charon-cmd*` has to be run as `*root*` (or more specifically as a user with
`*CAP_NET_ADMIN*` capability).

Of the options below at least `*--host*` and `*--identity*` are required.
Depending on the selected *authentication profile*, credentials also have to be
provided with their respective options.

Many of the `*charon*`-specific configuration options in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] also apply to `*charon-cmd*`.
For instance, to configure customized logging to `*stdout*` the following snippet
can be used:
----
charon-cmd {
  filelog {
    stdout {
      default = 1
      ike = 2
      cfg = 2
    }
  }
}
