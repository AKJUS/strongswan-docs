When a NAT router applies *Port Address Translation* to an outbound IP packet,
the address/port mapping is stored in an internal lookup table together with a
time-to-live value. This mapping is needed by the router so that inbound IP packets
can be translated back to the original address/port values.

Since an established IPsec connection can be inactive for minutes or even hours,
the IPsec peer behind a NAT router has to send periodic NAT-T keepalive UDP
packets containing a single `*0xff*` byte in order to refresh the NAT mapping entry
in the NAT router's lookup table.

Of course the NAT-T keepalives also reach the IPsec peer on the other side of the
connection but the packets are silently dropped by the kernel. By default the
keep-alives are sent ever `*20s*` but the interval can configured via the
`*charon.keep_alive*` parameter in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] (set to `*0*` to disable
sending keepalives, e.g. behind a static DNAT aka port forwarding).
