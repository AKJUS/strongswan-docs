ESP-in-UDP encapsulation means that an eight-byte UDP header is inserted between
the IP Header and the ESP Header of the ESP packet. At the outset, the UDP source
and destination ports are both set to the well-known value `*4500*` but might get
changed on the way by one or several NAT routers.

The first field in the ESP header right after the UDP header is the 32-bit non-zero
*Security Parameters Index* (SPI).
