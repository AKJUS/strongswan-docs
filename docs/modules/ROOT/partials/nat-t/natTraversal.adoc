Since the ESP protocol with IP protocol number `*50*` doesn't have any ports,
_per se_ it is not suited for *Port Address Translation*, the standard method of
traversing a NAT router for the TCP and UDP protocols.

Some NAT routers have a feature, often called something like *IPsec Passthrough*
that detects outbound IKE traffic from a single host behind the NAT device and
will forward inbound IKE and ESP packets to that specific host as shown in the
figure below

Unfortunately this
won't work with multiple IPsec clients behind the same NAT router that all want
to communicate with the same VPN gateway as shown in the network topology below

The solution proposed by {RFC3948}[RFC 3948] is to encapsulate ESP packets in
UDP datagrams which then allows to apply *Port Address Translation* as shown in
the figure above. The well-known *NAT Traversal* UDP port `*4500*` is shared with
the IKE protocol when a {RFC7296}#section-2.23[NAT situation is detected] between
the two IPsec endpoints. The detection is based on the `NAT_DETECTION_SOURCE_IP`
and `NAT_DETECTION_DESTINATION_IP` notifications sent in the `IKE_SA_INIT` exchange
that contain source and destination IP address hashes, respectively.

ESP-in-UDP encapsulation can be enforced even if no NAT situation exists by setting
`*encap = yes*` for a given connection definition in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. If enabled, the
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon will send a manipulated
`NAT_DETECTION_SOURCE_IP` notify payload so that it will look to the remote peer
as if there were a NAT situation.
