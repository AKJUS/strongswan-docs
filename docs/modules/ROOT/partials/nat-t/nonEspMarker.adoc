If the first 32 bits right after the UDP header are set to zero then instead of
an encapsulated ESP payload packet, an IKE management packet is carried. Thus this
four octet all-zero *Non-ESP Marker* is used to differentiate between ESP and IKE
traffic. ESP packets are processed in the kernel, whereas the IKE packets are
forwarded to the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] userland IKE daemon.
