If the first 32 bits right after the UDP header are set to zero, then an IKE
management packet is carried instead of an encapsulated ESP payload packet. This
four-byte all-zero *Non-ESP Marker* is used to differentiate between ESP and IKE
traffic. ESP packets are processed in the kernel, whereas the IKE packets are
forwarded to the xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] userland IKE daemon.
