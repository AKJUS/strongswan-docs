|cert<suffix>              |
|Since version 5.5.2. Subsection for a certificate candidate to use for
 authentication. Certificates in `*certs*` are transmitted as binary blobs whereas
 the `*cert*` subsections offer more flexibility

|cert<suffix>.file         |
|Absolute path to the certificate to load. Passed as-is to the daemon, so it must
 be readable by it. Configure either `*file*` or `*handle*` but not both in one
 section

|cert<suffix>.handle       |
|Hex-encoded `CKA_ID` or handle of the certificate on a token or
 xref:tpm/tpm2.adoc[TPM 2.0], respectively. Configure either `*handle*` or `*file*`
 but not both in one section

|cert<suffix>.slot         |
|Optional slot number of the token that stores the certificate

|cert<suffix>.module       |
|Optional PKCS#11 module name
