|engine_id                   |[->]
|ENGINE ID to use in the OpenSSL plugin.
`*[pkcs11]*`

|fips_mode                   |`0`
|Set OpenSSL FIPS mode.  With OpenSSL before 3.0, the supported values are
 disabled(`*0*`), enabled(`*1*`) and Suite B enabled(`*2*`).  With OpenSSL 3+,
 any value other than `*0*` will explicitly load the fips and base providers
 (`*load_legacy*` will be ignored). The latter still requires the config in
 `*fipsmodule.cnf*` (e.g. for the module's MAC), but allows explicitly loading
 the provider if it's not activated in that config

|load_legacy                 |`yes`
|Load the legacy provider in OpenSSL 3+ for algorithms like MD4, DES, or Blowfish
(the first two are required for EAP-MSCHAPv2). If disabled, the default provider
 is loaded, or those configured in the OpenSSL config (e.g. the fips provider)
