|strict  |`yes`
|If set to `*yes*`, a subject certificate without an `*IPAddrblock*` extension
 is rejected if the issuer certificate posesses an `*IPAddrblock*`  extension
 extension. If set to `*no*`, subject certificates issued without the
 `*IPAddrblock*` extension are accepted without any traffic selector checks and
 no policy is enforced by the plugin.
