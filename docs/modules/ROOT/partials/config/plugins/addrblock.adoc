|depth   |`-1`
|How deep towards the root CA to validate issuer cert `*IPAddrblock*`
 extensions (since version 5.9.6).

 {RFC3779}[RFC 3779] requires that all addrblocks claimed by a certificate must
 be contained in the `*IPAddrblock*` extension of the issuer certificate, up to
 the root CA.  The default depth setting of `*-1*` enforces this.

 In practice, third party (root) CAs may not contain the extension, making the
 `*IPAddrblock*` extension unusable under such CAs. By limiting the validation
 depth, only a certain level of issuer certificates are validated for proper
 `*IPAddrblock*` extensions: A depth of `*0*` does not check any issuer
 certificate extensions, a depth of `*1*` only the direct issuer of the end entity
 certificate is checkend, and so on.

|strict  |`yes`
|If set to `*yes*`, a subject certificate without an `*IPAddrblock*` extension
 is rejected if the issuer certificate posesses an `*IPAddrblock*`  extension
 extension. If set to `*no*`, subject certificates issued without the
 `*IPAddrblock*` extension are accepted without any traffic selector checks and
 no policy is enforced by the plugin.
