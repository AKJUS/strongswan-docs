|file                      |[->]
|File where name servers are written to if not using `*resolvconf(8)*`
`*[/etc/resolv.conf]*`

|resolvconf.iface          |[->]
|The interface name and protocol sent to `*resolvconf(8)*`. This has to be a
 valid interface name according to the rules defined by `*resolvconf*`.  Also,
 it should have a high priority according to the order defined in
 `*interface-order(8)*` if relevant on the system
 `*[lo.inet]*`

|resolvconf.path           |[->]
|Path/command for `*resolvconf(8)*` (since version 5.9.9). The command is
 executed by a shell, so `*"resolvconf"*` will work if it's in `$PATH` of the
 daemon. If not configured, `*resolvconf(8)*` will be used if found at the
 default location.  Otherwise, the file in `*charon.plugins.resolve.file*` will
 be modified directly
 `*[/sbin/resolvconf]*`
