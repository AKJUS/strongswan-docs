|force_server_address |`no`
|Always use the configured server addressfootnote:[
 If the DHCP server runs on the same host as the daemon with DHCP plugin, you
 may need to enable `*dhcp.force_server_address*` and then set `*dhcp.server*`
 to the local broadcast address, e.g. `192.168.0.255`. That's because some `DHCP`
 daemons do not listen on the loopback interface and thus can't be reached via
 unicast (or even broadcast `255.255.255.255`) from the same host.]

|identity_lease       |`no`
|Derive user-defined MAC address from hash of IKE identity. The `client identifier`
 DHCP option (`61`) containing the IKE identity is also sent if this setting is enabled

|interface            |
|Interface name the plugin uses for address allocation. The default is to bind
 to any (`0.0.0.0`) and let the system decide which way to route the packets
 to the DHCP server

|interface_receive    |[->]
|Interface name the plugin uses to bind its receive socket. The default is
 to use the same interface as the send socket. Set it to the empty string
 to avoid binding the receive socket to any interface while the send socket
 is bound to one. If the server runs on the same host and the send socket is
 bound to an interface, it might be necessary to set this to `lo` or the
 empty string. Since version 6.0.1

|server               |[->]
|DHCP server unicast or broadcast IP address. `*[255.255.255.255]*`

|use_server_port      |`no`
|Use the DHCP server port `67` as source port instead of the DHCP client port
 `68` when a unicast server address is configured and the plugin acts as relay
 agentfootnote:[
 When replying in this mode, the DHCP server will always send packets to the
 DHCP server port and if no process binds that port an `ICMP port unreachable`
 message will be sent back that might be problematic for some DHCP servers. To
 avoid that, enabling this option will cause the plugin to bind the DHCP server
 port to send its requests when acting as relay agent. This is not necessary if
 a DHCP server is already running on the same host and might even cause conflicts;
 and since the server port is already bound, ICMP messages should not be an
 issue.]
