|buflen                       |[->]
|Buffer size for received Netlink messages.
 `*[min(PAGE_SIZE, 8192)]*`

|force_receive_buffer_size    |`no`
|If the maximum Netlink socket receive buffer in bytes set by
 `*receive_buffer_size*` exceeds the system-wide maximum from
 `*/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max*`, this option can be used to override the limit.
 Enabling this option requires special privileges (`CAP_NET_ADMIN`)

|fwmark                       |
|Firewall mark to set on the routing rule that directs traffic to our own routing
 table. The format is `*[!]mark[/mask]*`, where the optional exclamation mark
 inverts  the meaning (i.e. the rule only applies to packets that don't match
 the mark). A possible use case is
 xref:plugins/kernel-libipsec.adoc#_Host_to_Host_Tunnels[host-to-host tunnels]
 with `*kernel-libipsec*`. When set to `*!<mark>*` a more efficient lookup for
 source and next-hop addresses may also be used since version 5.3.3

|hw_offload_feature_interface |`lo`
|If the kernel supports hardware offloading, the plugin needs to find the feature
 flag which represents hardware offloading support for network devices. Using the
 loopback device for this purpose is usually fine, since it should always be
 present. For rare cases in which the loopback device cannot be used to obtain
 the appropriate feature flag, this option can be used to specify an alternative
 interface for offload feature detection

|mss                         |`0`
|MSS to set on installed routes, `*0*` to disable

|mtu                         |`0`
|MTU to set on installed routes, `*0*` to disable

|process_rules               |`no`
|Whether to process changes in routing rules to trigger roam events. This is
 currently only useful if the kernel based route lookup is used (i.e. if route
 installation is disabled or an inverted fwmark match is configured)

|receive_buffer_size         |`0`
|Maximum Netlink socket receive buffer in bytes. This value controls how many
 bytes of Netlink messages can be received on a Netlink socket. The default value
 is set by `*/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default*`. The specified value cannot exceed
 the system-wide maximum from `*/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max*` unless
 `*force_receive_buffer_size*` is enabled

|roam_events                 |`yes`
|Whether to trigger roam events when interfaces, addresses or routes change

|set_proto_port_transport_sa |`no`
|Whether to set protocol and ports in the selector installed on transport mode
 IPsec SAs in the kernel. While doing so enforces policies for inbound traffic,
 it also prevents the use of a single IPsec SA by more than one traffic selector

|spdh_thresh                 |
|Subsection to configure XFRM policy hashing thresholds for IPv4 and IPv6. The
 section defines hashing thresholds to configure in the kernel during daemon
 startup. Each address family takes a threshold for the local subnet of an IPsec
 policy (src in out-policies, dst in in- and forward-policies) and the remote
 subnet (dst in out-policies, src in in- and forward-policies). If the subnet has
 more or equal net bits than the threshold, the first threshold bits are used to
 calculate a hash to lookup the policy. *Note: These settings are mostly obsolete
 since Linux 5.0, which started using a multi-level tree-based policy lookup.*

|spdh_thresh.ipv4.lbits     |`32`
|Local subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv4

|spdh_thresh.ipv4.rbits     |`32`
|Remote subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv4

|spdh_thresh.ipv6.lbits     |`128`
|Local subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv6

|spdh_thresh.ipv6.rbits     |`128`
|Remote subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv6

|xfrm_acq_expires           |`165`
|Lifetime of XFRM acquire state created by the kernel when traffic matches a trap
 policy. The value gets written to `*/proc/sys/net/core/xfrm_acq_expires*`.
 Indirectly controls the delay between XFRM acquire messages triggered by the
 kernel for a trap policy. The same value is used as timeout for SPIs allocated
 by the kernel. The default value equals the default total
 xref:config/retransmission.adoc[retransmission timeout] for IKE messages (since
 version 5.5.3 this value is determined dynamically based on the configuration)
