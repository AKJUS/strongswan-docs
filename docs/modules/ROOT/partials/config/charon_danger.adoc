WARNING: _Accept unencrypted ID and HASH payloads in IKEv1 Main Mode. Some
  implementations send the third Main Mode message unencrypted, probably to find
  the PSKs for the specified ID for authentication. This is very similar to
  Aggressive Mode and has the same security implications: A passive attacker can
  sniff the negotiated identity and can start brute forcing the PSK using the
  `HASH` payload. Don't enable this option unless you know exactly what the
  implications are and compatibility to such devices is required (e.g. some
  SonicWall boxes)._

WARNING: _If enabled, *IKE Responders* are allowed to use IKEv1 Aggressive Mode
  with Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs). This is strongly discouraged due to security
  concerns (offline attacks on the openly transmitted hash of the PSK)._
