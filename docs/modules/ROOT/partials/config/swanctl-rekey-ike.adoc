|<conn>.reauth_time        |`0s`
|Time to schedule IKE reauthentication. IKE reauthentication recreates the
 IKE/ISAKMP SA from scratch and re-evaluates the credentials. In asymmetric
 configurations (with EAP or configuration payloads) it might not be possible to
 actively reauthenticate as responder. The IKEv2 reauthentication lifetime
 negotiation can instruct the client to perform reauthentication. Reauthentication
 is disabled by default. Enabling it can usually result in short connection
 interruptions, even when using *make-before-break* reauthentication, which is
 now the default. However, they are significantly shorter than when using the
 legacy *break-before-make* approach, which could still be used for compatibility
 reasons by disabling `*charon.make_before_break*` in
 xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]

|<conn>.rekey_time         |`4h`
|IKE rekeying refreshes key material using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, but does
 not re-check associated credentials. It is supported with IKEv2 only. IKEv1
 performs a reauthentication procedure instead. With the default value, IKE
 rekeying is scheduled every `*4*` hours minus the configured `*rand_time*`. If
 a `*reauth_time*` is configured, `*rekey_time*` defaults to zero, disabling
 rekeying. In that case set `*rekey_time*` explicitly to both enforce rekeying and
 reauthentication

|<conn>.over_time          |[->]
|Hard IKE_SA lifetime if rekey/reauth does not complete, as time. To avoid having
 an IKE or ISAKMP connection kept alive if IKE reauthentication or rekeying fails
 perpetually, a maximum hard lifetime may be specified. If the IKE_SA fails to
 rekey or reauthenticate within the specified time, the IKE_SA gets closed.
 In contrast to CHILD_SA rekeying, `*over_time*` is relative in time to the
 `*rekey_time*` and `*reauth_time*` values, as it applies to both.
 The default is 10% of either `*rekey_time*` or `*reauth_time*`, whichever value
 is larger. [`0.1 * max(rekey_time, reauth_time)`]

|<conn>.rand_time          |[->]
|Time range from which to choose a random value to subtract from rekey/reauth
 times. To avoid having both peers initiating the rekey/reauth procedure
 simultaneously, a random time gets subtracted from the rekey/reauth times.
 The default is equal to the configured `*over_time*`. [`over_time`]
