|accept_private_algs                         |`no`
|Deliberately violate the IKE standard's requirement and allow the use of private
algorithm identifiers, even if the peer implementation is unknown (i.e. if the
peer doesn't send a vendor ID via `*send_vendor_id*`)

|block_threshold                             |`5`
|Maximum number of half-open IKE_SAs for a single peer IP

|cache_crls                                  |`no`
|Whether Certicate Revocation Lists (CRLs) fetched via HTTP or LDAP should be
 saved under a unique file name derived from the public key of the Certification
 Authority (CA) to xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*/etc/swanctl/x509crl*`]

|check_current_path                          |`no`
|By default, after detecting any changes to interfaces and/or addresses no action
 is taken if the current path to the remote peer still looks usable. Enabling
 this option will use DPD to check if the path actually still works, or, for
 instance, the peer removed the state after a longer phase without connectivity.
 It will also trigger a MOBIKE update if NAT mappings were removed during the
 downtime

|cert_cache                                  |`yes`
|Whether relations in validated certificate chains should be cached in memory

|cisco_flexvpn                               |`no`
|Send the Cisco FlexVPN vendor ID payload (IKEv2 only), which is required in order
 to make Cisco brand devices allow negotiating a local traffic selector (from
 strongSwan's point of view) that is not the assigned virtual IP address if such
 an address is requested by strongSwan. Sending the Cisco FlexVPN vendor ID
 prevents the peer from narrowing the initiator's local traffic selector and
 allows it to e.g. negotiate a TS of `*0.0.0.0/0 == 0.0.0.0/0*` instead.  This
 has been tested with a "tunnel mode ipsec ipv4" Cisco template but should also
 work for GRE encapsulation

|cisco_unity                                 |`no`
|Send Cisco Unity vendor ID payload (IKEv1 only),
 see xref:plugins/unity.adoc[`*unity*`] plugin

|close_ike_on_child_failure                  |`no`
|Close the `IKE SA` if setup of the `CHILD SA` along with IKE_AUTH failed

|cookie_threshold                            |`10`
|Number of half-open IKE_SAs that activate the cookie mechanism
