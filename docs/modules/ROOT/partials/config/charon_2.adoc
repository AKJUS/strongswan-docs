|delete_rekeyed                              |`no`
|Delete CHILD_SAs right after they got successfully rekeyed (IKEv1 only). Reduces
 the number of stale CHILD_SAs in scenarios with a lot of rekeyings. However this
 might cause problems with implementations that continue to use rekeyed SAs until
 they expire

|delete_rekeyed_delay                        |`5`
|Delay in seconds until inbound IPsec SAs are deleted after rekeyings (IKEv2 only).
 To process delayed packets the inbound part of a CHILD_SA is kept installed up
 to the configured number of seconds after it got replaced during a rekeying. If
 set to `*0*` the CHILD_SA will be kept installed until it expires. If no
 lifetime is set it will be destroyed immediately

|dh_exponent_ansi_x9_42                      |`yes`
|Use ANSI X9.42 DH exponent size or optimum size matched to cryptographical
 strength

|Use RTLD_NOW with dlopen() when loading plugins and IMV/IMCs to reveal missing
 symbols immediately. Useful during development of custom plugins

|DNS server assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP), see
 xref:plugins/attr.adoc[`*attr*`] plugin

|dns2                                        |

xref:config/logging.adoc[logger configuration]

|flush_auth_cfg                              |`no`
|If enabled objects used during authentication (certificates, identities etc.)
 are released to free memory once an IKE_SA is established. Enabling this might
 conflict with plugins that later need access to e.g. the used certificates

|follow_redirects                            |`yes`
|Whether to follow IKEv2 redirects, see {RFC5685}[RFC 5685]

|force_eap_only_authentication               |`no`
|Violate  the *EAP-only* authentication requirements according to
 {RFC5998}[RFC 5998], even if the peer did not send an `EAP_ONLY_AUTHENTICATION`
 notify during `IKE_AUTH`

|fragment_size                               |`1280`
|Maximum size (complete IP datagram size in bytes) of a sent IKE fragment when
 using proprietary IKEv1 or standardized IKEv2 fragmentation, defaults to `*1280*`
 (use `*0*` for address family specific default values, which uses a lower value
 for IPv4). If specified this limit is used for both IPv4 and IPv6

|group                                       |
|Name of the xref:install/reducedPrivileges.adoc[group] the daemon changes
 to after startup

|half_open_timeout                           |`30`
|Timeout in seconds for connecting IKE_SAs, also see
 xref:config/jobPriority.adoc#_ike_sa_init_dropping[IKE_SA_INIT dropping]

|hash_and_url                                |`no`
|Enable hash and URL support

|host_resolver.max_threads                   |`3`
|Maximum number of concurrent resolver threads (they are terminated if unused)

|Minimum number of resolver threads to keep around

|ignore_acquire_ts                           |`no`
|If this is disabled the traffic selectors from the kernel's acquire events,
 which are derived from the triggering packet, are prepended to the traffic
 selectors from the configuration for IKEv2 connection. By enabling this, such
 specific traffic selectors will be ignored and only the ones in the config will
 be sent. This always happens for IKEv1 connections as the protocol only supports
 one set of traffic selectors per `CHILD SA`

|ignore_routing_tables                       |
|A space-separated list of routing tables to be excluded from route lookup

|ikesa_limit                                 |`0`

connection attempts are blocked

|ikesa_table_segments                        |`1`
|Number of exclusively locked segments in the hash table, see
 xref:ikeSaTable.adock[IKE_SA lookup tuning]

|ikesa_table_size                            |`1`

|install_routes                              |`yes`

 and other strongSwan libraries as well as and plugin integrity at startup

|interfaces_ignore                           |
|A comma-separated list of network interfaces that should be ignored by the
 xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon. If `*interfaces_use*` is specified,
 this option has no effect

|interfaces_use                              |
|A comma-separated list of network interfaces that should be used by the
 xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon. All other interfaces are ignored

 instead of a NAT keep alive (`*0*` to disable).  This is only useful if a clock
 is used that includes time spent suspended (e.g. `*CLOCK_BOOTTIME*`)
