|load                                        |
|Plugins to load in IKEv2 charon daemon, see
 xref:plugins/pluginLoad.adoc[Plugin Load]

|load_modular                                |`no`
|If enabled the list of plugins to load is determined by individual `*load*`
 settings for each plugin, see
 xref:plugins/pluginLoad.adoc#_modular_configuration[Modular Configuration]

|make_before_break                           |`no`
|Initiate IKEv2 reauthentication with a make-before-break instead of a
 break-before-make scheme. Make-before-break uses overlapping `IKE` and `CHILD SA`
 during reauthentication by first recreating all new SAs before deleting the old
 ones. This behavior can be beneficial to avoid connectivity gaps during
 reauthentication, but requires support for overlapping SAs by the peer.
 strongSwan can handle such overlapping SAs since version 5.3.0

|max_ikev1_exchanges                         |`3`
|Maximum number of IKEv1 phase 2 exchanges per IKE_SA to keep state about and <
 track concurrently

|max_packet                                  |[->]
|Maximum packet size in bytes accepted by charon
 `*[10000]*`

|multiple_authentication                     |`yes`
|Enable multiple authentication exchanges, see {RFC4739}[RFC 4739]

|nbns1                                       |
|WINS server assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP), see

|port                                        |`500`
|UDP port used locally. If set to 0 a random port will be allocated

|port_nat_t                                  |`4500`
|UDP port used locally in case of NAT-T. If set to 0 a random port will be
 allocated. Has to be different from `*port*`, otherwise a random port will be
 allocated

|prefer_best_path                            |`no`
|By default, charon keeps SAs on the routing path with addresses it previously
 used if that path is still usable. By enabling this option, it tries more
 aggressively to update SAs with MOBIKE on routing priority changes using the
 cheapest path. This adds more noise, but allows to dynamically adapt SAs to
 routing priority changes. This option has no effect if MOBIKE is not supported
 or disabled

|prefer_configured_proposals                 |`yes`
|Prefer locally configured proposals for IKE/IPsec over supplied ones as responder
 (disabling this can avoid keying retries due to `INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD` notifies)

|prefer_temporary_addrs                      |`no`
|By default public IPv6 addresses are preferred over temporary ones according
 to {RFC4941}[RFC 4941] to make connections more stable. Enable this option to
 reverse this.

|process_route                               |`yes`
|Process `RTM_NEWROUTE` and `RTM_DELROUTE` events

|processor.priority_threads                  |

|rdn_matching                                |[->]
|How the Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs) a certificate's Subject Distinguished
 Name (DN) is composed of, are matched against configured identities. Possible
 values are `*strict*` (the default), `*reordered*`, and `*relaxed*`.  With
 `*strict*` the number, type and order of all RDNs have to match. Wildcards (`***`)
 for RDN values are allowed (that's the case for all three variants). Using
 `*reordered*` also matches a DN if the RDNs appear in a different order, The
 number and type still have to match. Finally `*relaxed*` also allows matches of
 DNs that contain more RDNs than the configured identity (missing RDNs are
 treated like a wildcard match). Note that `*reordered*` and `*relaxed*` impose a
 considerable overhead on memory usage and runtime, in particular for mismatches
 as compared to `*strict*`.
