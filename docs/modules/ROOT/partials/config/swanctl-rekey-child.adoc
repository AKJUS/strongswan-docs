|<child>.rekey_time        |`1h`
|Time to schedule CHILD_SA rekeying. CHILD_SA rekeying refreshes key material,
 optionally using a Diffie-Hellman exchange if a group is specified in the proposal.
 To avoid rekey collisions initiated by both ends simultaneously, a value in the
 range of `*rand_time*` gets subtracted to form the effective soft lifetime. By
 default CHILD_SA rekeying is scheduled every hour, minus `*rand_time*`

|<child>.life_time         |[->]
|Maximum lifetime before CHILD_SA gets closed. Usually this hard lifetime is never
 reached, because the CHILD_SA gets rekeyed before. If that fails for whatever
 reason, this limit closes the CHILD_SA. The default is 10% more than the
 `*rekey_time*`. [`1.1 * rekey_time`]

|<child>.rand_time         |[->]
|Time range from which to choose a random value to subtract from `*rekey_time*`.
 The default is the difference between `*life_time*` and `*rekey_time*`.
 [`life_time - rekey_time`]

|<child>.rekey_bytes       |`0`
|Number of bytes processed before initiating CHILD_SA rekeying. CHILD_SA rekeying
 refreshes key material, optionally using a Diffie-Hellman exchange if a group is
 specified in the proposal. To avoid rekey collisions initiated by both ends
 simultaneously, a value in the range of `*rand_bytes*` gets subtracted to form
 the effective soft volume limit. Volume based CHILD_SA rekeying is disabled by
 default

|<child>.life_bytes        |
|Maximum bytes processed before CHILD_SA gets closed. Usually this hard volume
 limit is never reached, because the CHILD_SA gets rekeyed before. If that fails
 for whatever reason, this limit closes the CHILD_SA. The default is 10% more than
 `*rekey_bytes*`. [`1.1 * rekey_bytes`]

|<child>.rand_bytes        |[->]
|Byte range from which to choose a random value to subtract from `*rekey_bytes*`.
 The default is the difference between `*life_bytes*` and `*rekey_bytes*`.
 [`life_bytes - rekey_bytes`]

|<child>.rekey_packets     |`0`
|Number of packets processed before initiating CHILD_SA rekeying. CHILD_SA rekeying
 refreshes key material, optionally using a Diffie-Hellman exchange if a group is
 specified in the proposal. To avoid rekey collisions initiated by both ends
 simultaneously, a value in the range of `*rand_packets*` gets subtracted to form
 the effective soft packet count limit. Packet count based CHILD_SA rekeying is
 disabled by default

|<child>.life_packets      |[->]
|Maximum number of packets processed before CHILD_SA gets closed. Usually this
 hard packets limit is never reached, because the CHILD_SA gets rekeyed before.
 If that fails for whatever reason, this limit closes the CHILD_SA. The default
 is 10% more than `*rekey_bytes*`. [`1.1 * rekey_packets`]

|<child>.rand_packets      |[->]
|Packet range from which to choose a random value to subtract from `*rekey_packets*`.
 The default is the difference between `*life_packets*` and `*rekey_packets*`.
 [`life_packets - rekey_packets`]
