|<child>.rekey_time        |[->]
|Time to schedule CHILD_SA rekeying. CHILD_SA rekeying refreshes key material,
 optionally using a Diffie-Hellman exchange if a group is specified in the proposal.
 To avoid rekey collisions initiated by both ends simultaneously, a value in the
 range of `*rand_time*` gets subtracted to form the effective soft lifetime.
 If `*life_time*` is explicitly configured, it defaults to 10% less than that,
 otherwise CHILD_SA rekeying is scheduled every hour, minus `*rand_time*`.
 [`1h` or `life_time / 1.1`]

|<child>.life_time         |[->]
|Maximum lifetime before CHILD_SA gets closed. Usually this hard lifetime is never
 reached, because the CHILD_SA gets rekeyed before. If that fails for whatever
 reason, this limit closes the CHILD_SA. The default is 10% more than the
 `*rekey_time*`. [`1.1 * rekey_time`]

|<child>.rand_time         |[->]
|Time range from which to choose a random value to subtract from `*rekey_time*`.
 The default is the difference between `*life_time*` and `*rekey_time*`.
 [`life_time - rekey_time`]

|<child>.rekey_bytes       |[->]
|Number of bytes processed before initiating CHILD_SA rekeying. CHILD_SA rekeying
 refreshes key material, optionally using a Diffie-Hellman exchange if a group is
 specified in the proposal. To avoid rekey collisions initiated by both ends
 simultaneously, a value in the range of `*rand_bytes*` gets subtracted to form
 the effective soft volume limit. Volume based CHILD_SA rekeying is disabled by
 default. If `*life_bytes*` is explicitly configured, it defaults to 10% less
 than that. [`0` or `life_bytes / 1.1`]

|<child>.rekey_packets     |[->]
|Number of packets processed before initiating CHILD_SA rekeying. CHILD_SA rekeying
 refreshes key material, optionally using a Diffie-Hellman exchange if a group is
 specified in the proposal. To avoid rekey collisions initiated by both ends
 simultaneously, a value in the range of `*rand_packets*` gets subtracted to form
 the effective soft packet count limit. Packet count based CHILD_SA rekeying is
 disabled by default. If `*life_packets*` is explicitly configured, it defaults
 to 10% less than that. [`0` or `life_packets / 1.1`]

|<child>.life_packets      |[->]
|Maximum number of packets processed before CHILD_SA gets closed. Usually this
